# Homeserver_2025 | *The most recent iteration* 

 
  I would say that i started my home lab journey a little over a year ago, and i have to be completely honest.. it is extremely addicting! My home "cyberlab" started out on my labtop for learning cyber security and linux. I started it on a 2023 MacBook Pro. After a month or so, I remember watching tons of YouTube videos on home labs and decided that I wanted to try to expand my lab by integrating another computer into it. After a lot more YouTube videos I was able to place my gaming laptop into the setup. It is a 2023 Razer Blade 16.

## Brief timeline

  Fast forward a few months and I decided to buy a Lenovo thinkpad t480 and sell the Mac so that I could really dive deep into Linux and the world of cyber security. I guess I could of made it easier on myself but chose not to, I dove head first into Arch Linux. (I Use Arch BTW) 

  Getting in the time machine again and here we are. I am working on a Bachelors degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at WGU, transferring from my local community college where i was studying Computer Science. I run Arch with SwayFX as my daily driver and I Have a new "cyberlab"

## Bigger and better

  My cyberlab consists of a desktop server with a X99 motherboard, i7 CPU, rtx GPU (I don't remember the exact name right now, sorry), 3TB HDD, and 512GB SSD. I know I know, I have only one hard drive but I just got bought it from a friend without any prior warning so, Ill get more storage for it later on. 

  I am running TrueNAS Scale on it, instead of Proxmox like my previous setup. I think I actually like this it better this way. I was having a lot of problems on Proxmox with getting things like Home Assistant setup correctly. 

  So far I am hosting Home Assistant, Ollama, Tailscale, and Nextcloud (I'm making a cloud for my family). I am also looking into making a VLAN to rebuild the cyberlab for cybersecurity testing. I have been focused more on the red teaming side of things with, practicing on CTF's (not to good at it yet), a few Hackthebox machines and overthewire wargames. 

## Whats next 

  Besides all of that I would still like to know the defensive side of cybersecurity as well, so I plan on doing some research on how to get a SIEM set up correctly. I have been debating on weather I should also create a VM on the server just for learning or continue to run a kali VM on my daily driver and ssh into the lab. With so much going on with the server I kind of feel like it would make things a little less complicated if I went with the server lab. But at the same time, I should also keep kali on my thinkpad for when I am practicing the pentest process. 

More to come...
